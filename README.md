# Monitoring-Student-attention-in-an-online-class-through-computer-vision

Due to the arrival of the coronavirus, the education system has completely transformed. In the
wake of this medical emergency and keeping the student's safety in mind with their academic
concern, the schools and colleges have endorsed online classes. But in an online lecture, the
teacher is entirely unaware of the attention levels of the students. Analysing who is attentive
and who is not through video of each student is a daunting task. Also, streaming video of all
students on such platforms results in buffering.

The idea is to automate the task of manually analysing attention of students by creating an
application that can track the attention levels of each student that are currently present in the
online class. This application analyses the video feed of each student through a webcam output
that data and sends that data to the teacher. The attention levels of each student received
displays on the dashboard that frequently updates the values of students in the online class.

It is a desktop application that has a common entry interface for both teachers and students.
Teachers upon starting a new class get a class code which is necessary for students to enter in
an online class. This application does not record or stream video from the student-side to the
teacher-side instead it sends the attention level of each student after analysing the video feed
of students through webcam.
